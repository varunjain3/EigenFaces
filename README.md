# Assignment-2 EE321 Probability and Random Processes
This repository was made as an assigmnet for the FALL2020 course EE321. In this project we demonstrate the Viola-Jones algorithm for detecting faces and Eigen Faces 
method to recognise various faces.

## Problem Statement
You all are aware that face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. A typical face recognition system involves face detection followed by classification. In this assignment, you will be implementing the classic Viola Jones Algorithm for detecting the face(s) in the image and then classify the detected faces using the idea of Eigen Faces.

## Background
This piece of work by Viola-Jones was notable for a couple of reasons. One,
it was the major use of Machine learning and Computer Vision. Two, was the
very fast commercialization of this algorithm. This academic piece of research
published in 2001, went on to be shipped into digital cameras. Undoubtedly,
itâ€™s an interesting chance to explore and understand how well could you apply
your theory to practice.

## Dataset
The [Yale Face Database](http://cvc.cs.yale.edu/cvc/projects/yalefaces/yalefaces.html) (size 6.4MB) contains 165 grayscale images in GIF format of 15 individuals. 
There are 11 images per subject, one per different facial expression or configuration: 
center-light, w/glasses, happy, left-light, w/no glasses, normal, right-light, sad, sleepy, surprised, and wink.

The database is publically available for non-commercial use. In order for us to track those using it, please 
fill in the following form. Let us know if you have any problems.  (NOTE: This works only with Netscape 4.75 (and below) under Windows or Linux/Unix. 
It will NOT work with Internet Explorer or Netscape 6.)
